     <section id="Writing"><h1>WRITING</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        Writing, I like writing abou nature, youth etc. Writing is one of the most important thing as it helps us to recollect our history, help us to know about the world etc. I have participated in many writing competitions and I liked it a lot. Writing is incomplete without reading, so my favroite book is "Girl power" because it includes important writing skills.<br> <br>
